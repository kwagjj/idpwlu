There are a lot of people using the same password for many websites. Even though you could diversify your password between different websites, I'm pretty sure you can only memorize only a few passwords. Using same passwords for many websites/services is not a good practice since if one password gets exposes, there's a great chance that the hacker will be able to get access to your accounts in other websites. One way to avoid such a scenario is to use unique passwords for each account in whatever website you use. But this practice will either require extraordinary memory or some method to save and query the password for your account. Project 'idpwlu', short for 'id/pw lookup', aims to implement the latter approach.
